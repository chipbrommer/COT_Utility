CoT Utility v0.2.0. 

This project was originally created to parse XML CoT messages being received from an external source into my C++11 and legacy C applications under the name COT_Parser.

Since, I have decided to expand upon my initial creation to transition this into more of a full CoT utility that will parse and generate XML CoT messages with the hope that other users can find use for this library to implement their applications with WinTAK, ATAK, or other CoT related communication items.

This project has a good base and I would like to expand more on it if outside users have needs / requests for addition support of desired fields. 
Feel free to submit issues for enhancements. 

Examples:
Please see the 'examples.cpp' for a list of use case scenarios I have created.
